GHOST (General meta-Heuristic Optimization Solving Tool) is a C# library designed to solve combinatorial satisfaction and optimization problems within some tenth of milliseconds. It has been originally designed to handle StarCraft: Brood War-related problems.

GHOST is a framework aiming to easily model and implement satisfaction and optimization problems. It contains a meta-heuristic solver aiming to solve any kind of these problems represented by a CSP/COP. It is a generalization of the C++ Wall-in project (https://github.com/richoux/Wall-in) and a C# adaptation and improvement of the GHOST's C++ version (https://github.com/richoux/GHOST).
